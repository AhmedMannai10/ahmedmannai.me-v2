summary: Exploring the 13 principles of the Cult of Done Manifesto and how they can positively impact your programming journey
---

In the world of programming, the quest for perfection can be an unrelenting obstacle to progress. It's easy to fall into the trap of endlessly fine-tuning, refining, and editing your work, while never truly completing anything. The Cult of Done Manifesto offers a refreshing perspective on how to approach your work in a more efficient and effective way. This manifesto comprises 13 guiding principles that encourage programmers and creators to embrace the idea of "done" rather than chasing an elusive perfection. Let's explore these principles and how they can positively impact your programming journey.

## 1. Three States of Being

The manifesto begins by defining the three fundamental states of being in any project: not knowing, action, and completion. Understanding this can help you navigate your tasks better. Identify where you are in this cycle and act accordingly.

## 2. Accept That Everything Is a Draft

In programming, it's easy to get bogged down in perfecting every detail of your code. The manifesto encourages you to embrace the concept that everything is a draft. By doing so, you free yourself from the anxiety of making mistakes and can focus on getting things done.

## 3. No Editing Stage

Perfectionism often leads to endless editing and revisions, causing projects to drag on. The manifesto advises you to skip the editing stage, at least initially. Instead, aim to complete the task and come back to refine it later.

## 4. Embrace Uncertainty

The manifesto acknowledges that pretending to know what you're doing is as good as actually knowing. Embrace the uncertainty that comes with programming. Take action, even when you're not entirely sure, and you'll find that progress is made.

## 5. Banish Procrastination

Procrastination is the enemy of productivity. The manifesto sets a strict rule: if you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it. This rule forces you to prioritize and take action promptly.

## 6. The Point of Being Done

Being "done" isn't just about completion; it's a means to an end. The goal is to free up your resources to tackle other tasks and projects. Avoid getting stuck in the minutiae of a single project.

## 7. Discard Perfectionism

Perfectionism can be a creativity killer. The manifesto encourages you to laugh at perfection and consider it boring. It's the imperfections and unique aspects of your work that often make it special.

## 8. Embrace Learning Through Doing

The manifesto asserts that people without "dirty hands" (those who don't take action) are wrong. Doing something, even if it leads to failure or mistakes, is a vital part of learning and growing in your field.

## 9. Failure Counts as Done

Mistakes and failures should be seen as accomplishments. They are proof that you've taken action and learned from the experience. Don't fear failure; embrace it as part of the process.

## 10. Destruction Is a Variant of Done

Sometimes, in programming, you may need to deconstruct your work or abandon a project to start afresh. The manifesto acknowledges that such destruction is a legitimate form of "done."

## 11. The Internet as a Tool for Progress

Sharing your ideas and work on the internet is considered a form of "done." It allows others to benefit from your knowledge and contributes to the collective growth of the programming community.

## 12. Done is the Engine of More

Completion of one task fuels your momentum to tackle the next one. The manifesto emphasizes that "done" is not an endpoint but a stepping stone to achieving more in your programming journey.

In conclusion, the Cult of Done Manifesto offers a refreshing perspective on productivity in the world of programming. By embracing imperfection, taking prompt action, and treating failure as a milestone, you can become a more effective and efficient programmer. So, next time you're stuck in the quagmire of perfectionism, remember the principles of this manifesto and let "done" drive your progress.
