# Rekindling My Passion for Coding

**Hello World!**

It has been a while since I posted something on the internet. I've realized that I've been overthinking every decision I make, which is kind of frustrating.

See, I spent a lot of time just thinking about doing good stuff, building projects, posting articles like this. Every time, I thought I should make the perfect article, the perfect software product, the perfect YouTube video, and each time I ended up doing nothing.

However, recently I've been working on some tasks in my job, and I've learned that what's important is to come up with a solution/result in a short period of time and then iterate to improve it. This works for developing apps, creating articles, making videos... . Lately, I've been watching Y Combinator videos on startups, and it seems that this rule also works for building MVPs and startups.

Now that I fully grasp this idea, I feel like I'm freed from my over-analyzing thoughts, to the point of avoiding ***paralysis by analysis***. Yeah, the first step is sharing this article and embarking on the journey of exploring ideas, building stuff without barriers.

This principle got me back to the actual **Why** - the reason that got me into software engineering, which is Engineering -> building interesting and exciting stuff. Now I feel like I want to start coding a new fun project again. I don't care if that project ends up failing or whatever; a failed project is better than no project at all. You won't regret failing, but you will regret not trying.

So yeah, let's build some fun projects, and I'll be sharing the process here. Check back soon, and we'll meet in the next article. I don't know what it will be about, but see you there, buddy.

Don't forget to throw away those overwhelming thoughts and start working on the things you truly want to do. It doesn't have to be perfect, it doesn't even have to be good. I mean look at this it is kind of bad Article. But yeah, fuck it, I'm sharing it. Who cares!

Peace. âœŒ
