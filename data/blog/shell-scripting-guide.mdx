### Shell Scripting Guide

#### **Introduction**

Shell scripting is a powerful way to automate tasks, simplify complex workflows, and improve efficiency in daily operations. A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of commands that the shell interprets and executes. Shell scripting is essential in areas such as system administration, DevOps, and CI/CD pipelines, making it a valuable skill for engineers working with Linux systems. By learning shell scripting, engineers can automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and create robust workflows with minimal manual intervention.

#### **Key Concepts in Shell Scripting**

1. **Shebang (**``**)**: The shebang is the first line of a shell script and specifies the interpreter to be used for executing the script. For example:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   ```

   This tells the system to use the Bash shell to run the script.

2. **Variables**: Variables store data that can be used and manipulated within a script.

   ```bash
   # Defining variables
   name="John Doe"
   echo "Hello, $name"
   ```

3. **Conditionals**: Shell scripts can use `if`, `elif`, `else`, and `case` statements to make decisions.

   ```bash
   if [ $1 -gt 10 ]; then
       echo "The number is greater than 10."
   else
       echo "The number is 10 or less."
   fi
   ```

4. **Loops**: Loops allow repetitive execution of commands.

   - **For loop**:
     ```bash
     for file in *.txt; do
         echo "Processing $file"
     done
     ```
   - **While loop**:
     ```bash
     count=1
     while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
         echo "Count: $count"
         count=$((count + 1))
     done
     ```

5. **Functions**: Functions enable code reuse and better organization.

   ```bash
   greet() {
       echo "Hello, $1!"
   }
   greet "Alice"
   ```

#### **Examples of Common Use Cases**

1. **Automating Backups**: Automate file backups using `tar`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   source_dir="/path/to/source"
   backup_dir="/path/to/backup"
   tar -czf "$backup_dir/backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz" $source_dir
   echo "Backup completed."
   ```

2. **Working with Files**: Renaming all `.txt` files to `.bak`:

   ```bash
   for file in *.txt; do
       mv "$file" "${file%.txt}.bak"
   done
   ```

3. **Parsing Data**: Extract specific lines from a log file:

   ```bash
   grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog > error_logs.txt
   ```

#### **Tips and Best Practices**

- **Use Descriptive Variable Names**: This improves script readability and maintainability.
  ```bash
  user_name="Alice"
  ```
- **Add Comments**: Document the purpose of commands for clarity.
  ```bash
  # This loop processes all .txt files
  ```
- **Error Handling**: Check for potential errors and handle them gracefully.
  ```bash
  if [ ! -d "$backup_dir" ]; then
      echo "Backup directory does not exist."
      exit 1
  fi
  ```
- **Test Incrementally**: Test your scripts in parts before running them fully.
- **Use ShellCheck**: A linting tool that checks for errors and potential issues in shell scripts.

#### **Real-World Applications**

1. **DevOps**: Automate deployment pipelines and infrastructure provisioning. Example: Starting or stopping Docker containers based on conditions.

   ```bash
   if docker ps | grep -q my_app; then
       docker stop my_app
   else
       docker start my_app
   fi
   ```

2. **System Administration**: Monitor disk usage and send alerts.

   ```bash
   usage=$(df / | grep / | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
   if [ $usage -gt 80 ]; then
       echo "Disk usage is critically high: $usage%"
   fi
   ```

3. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automate build and test scripts.

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Running tests..."
   ./run_tests.sh && echo "All tests passed!" || echo "Tests failed."
   ```
