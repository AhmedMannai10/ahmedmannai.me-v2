# How to embed a responsive YouTube video in React with Tailwind CSS

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of embedding a responsive YouTube video into a React application while using the popular CSS framework, Tailwind CSS. By the end of this guide, you'll have a sleek and responsive YouTube video player integrated into your React project.

## In Short:

Here is a component that contains a responsive YouTube video by using the style from tailwind `aspect-video`

```jsx
<div className="aspect-video">
  <iframe
    className="h-full w-full rounded-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WiH9pf2ULQ?si=2TzjHgKzRDOgi528"
    width="100%"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
```

## Setup React & Tailwind CSS

The following steps are for setting up a react project with tailwind CSS:

### Step 1: Create a React Project

If you don't have a React project set up, you can create one using `create-react-app:`

```bash
npx create-react-app youtube-video-embed
cd youtube-video-embed
npm start
```

### Setup 2: Install Tailwind CSS

To use Tailwind CSS in your React project, install it by running the following command:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss
```

Once it's installed, you'll need to create a configuration file:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

### Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS

Open the `tailwind.config.js` file generated in your project root and update it to include the following:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false,
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

### Step 4: Embed the youtube video

In your React Project, create a new component that will display the YouTube video. For example, `YouTubeEmbed.js`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const YouTubeEmbed = ({ embedId }) => {
  return (
    <div className="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9">
      <iframe
        className="h-full w-full"
        src={`https://www.youtube.com/embed/${embedId}`}
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
      ></iframe>
    </div>
  )
}

export default YouTubeEmbed
```

Congratulations! You've successfully embedded a responsive YouTube video into your React application using Tailwind CSS. You can further customize the appearance and styling of the video player by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes in the YouTubeEmbed component to match your project's design.
